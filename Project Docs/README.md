Project Title: 
PacMen Exercise

Description: 
Create a webpage where we can add PacMen with random positioning and velocity with the click of a button. There are to be two buttons: one to add PacMen & one to start the game. The PacMen are supposed to bounce off the window edges as if they are stuck in a box.

How To Run: 
A. Download the required files from the repository
B. Ensure all files are located in the same folder
C. Load 'index.html' in a web browser page (eg: Google Chrome) by dragging and dropping
C. Press the buttons to play the game

Project Status:
Ongoing (last updated 06132023)

Roadmap of future improvements:
A. Create a stop game button
B. Create a remove pacmen button
